➡ Application for students that helps them in everyday activities. 

Users choose their city and then can see popular activities and attractions among students in chosen city - 
for example night clubs, cheap cafes and restaurants etc. Users can leave reviews on existing places and add new ones. 
It's like student-friendly reviwing app where they  can find about all student benefits and save some money (and rather spend on coffee). 

Students have to make their account and login in at the beginning. They can create reviews, edit and delete them. 
In addition, they can see other people's reviews and mark specific locations as favorite places.
